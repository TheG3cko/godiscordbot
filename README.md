# About

This is a Discord bot written in Go that lets you chat with an LLM right in your server.
It doesn’t really do anything useful right now—I mostly built it to learn Go.
The code’s kinda messy since it’s one of my first solo projects, so don’t expect anything fancy.

# Config
Right now, ENV variables are used for configuring the bot.
```bash
export DISCORD_TOKEN=''
export CHANNEL_ID=''
export OLLAMA_HOST=''
```
